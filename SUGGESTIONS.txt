   ___THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO BE CONSIDERED___

__CALLING__
```so you can call a character to
hangout with them easily instead of having
to go all the way to their house and then
wasting time```



__ANIMALS__
```animals in the forest/mountains,
maybe like rabbits or snow tigers,
(can be classed as a job and get job
experience & money)
some animals are hostile and others
are not```



__CITIZEN CLASS__
```they could be lower class,
middle class or upper class

lower class: less likely to have
a weapon, less cash when you loot

middle class: ehh likely to have
a weapon, more cash when you loot

upper class: HAS a weapon, ALOT
more cash when you loot
the ranges i'm looking for
lower: 1-3
middle: 3-5
upper: 10-13

(i forgot who had the ability
but they can see the age of people
and they will also be able to see the
class if you consider adding it?)```






     ___THINGS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY___
(things you are considering incase
you haven't saved this or smth)

__HEALTH BARS__
```shows health bars above npcs```



__PUNCHING__
```pretty self explanatory, 
punching does little damage,
new item called "brass knuckles", 
doubles punching damage by 2x```




__WAYPOINTS__
```makes it so that you can place a marker 
somewhere and it will tell you how close 
you are to there (like in 3008)```




__TRIGGERED DIALOGUE__

example:

```picking flowers ("that's nice who are you picking those for"),

entering the gun store ("are u crazy!?"),

stealing a car ("atleast the police are horrible and won't do anything"),```



__LUCK POTIONS__
```luck potions increase the chances of you
getting rares or anything above rare,
2x luck cost: 40
4x luck cost : 160
8x luck cost : 560
16x luck cost : 1200```



__HARD MODE__
```in settings, 
CONS:
increases damage dealt to you, 
worse luck rates

PROS:
2x more money earnt in that gamemode```



__TOOLS__
```speeds things up like picking flowers
etc.```
