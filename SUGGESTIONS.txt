   ___THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO BE CONSIDERED___

__CALLING__
```so you can call a character to
hangout with them easily instead of having
to go all the way to their house and then
wasting time```







     ___THINGS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY___
(things you are considering incase
you haven't saved this or smth)

__HEALTH BARS__
```shows health bars above npcs```



__PUNCHING__
```pretty self explanatory, 
punching does little damage,
new item called "brass knuckles", 
doubles punching damage by 2x```




__WAYPOINTS__
```makes it so that you can place a marker 
somewhere and it will tell you how close 
you are to there (like in 3008)```




__TRIGGERED DIALOGUE__

example:

```picking flowers ("that's nice who are you picking those for"),

entering the gun store ("are u crazy!?"),

stealing a car ("atleast the police are horrible and won't do anything"),```



__LUCK POTIONS__
```luck potions increase the chances of you
getting rares or anything above rare,
2x luck cost: 40
4x luck cost : 160
8x luck cost : 560
16x luck cost : 1200```



__HARD MODE__
```in settings, 
CONS:
increases damage dealt to you, 
worse luck rates

PROS:
2x more money earnt in that gamemode```



__TOOLS__
```speeds things up like picking flowers
etc.```
