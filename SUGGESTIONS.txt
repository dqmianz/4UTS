   ___THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO BE CONSIDERED___


           __CHARACTER CUSTOMISATION__
```more hairstyles, also stacked hairstyles
more faces to choose from
could be more clothes but idrc about that
too much```



__MORE WAYS TO GET MONEY__
```more money dropped when killing civillians
then robbing them, people aren't living
off of 3.01```



__NEW HANGOUT SYSTEM__
```the more time you spend hanging out 
with them, you get "friend" points which
adds more dialogue and could also 
potentially commit crimes with you 
depending on the points & the character

i notice they take lots of long routes 
instead of short routes, they definitely 
need more routes to go across,
they usually get stuck in places where you can sit down (like the pizza place)```



__HARD MODE__
```in settings, 
CONS:
increases damage dealt to you, 
worse luck rates

PROS:
2x more money earnt in that gamemode```



     ___THINGS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY___
(things you are considering incase
you haven't saved this or smth)

__HEALTH BARS__
```shows health bars above npcs```



__PUNCHING__
```pretty self explanatory, 
punching does little damage,
new item called "brass knuckles", 
doubles punching damage by 2x```




__WAYPOINTS__
```makes it so that you can place a marker 
somewhere and it will tell you how close 
you are to there (like in 3008)```




__TRIGGERED DIALOGUE__

example:

```picking flowers ("that's nice who are you picking those for"),

entering the gun store ("are u crazy!?"),

stealing a car ("atleast the police are horrible and won't do anything"),```



__LUCK POTIONS__
```luck potions increase the chances of you
getting rares or anything above rare,
2x luck cost: 40
4x luck cost : 160
8x luck cost : 560
16x luck cost : 1200```
