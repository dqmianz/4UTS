dialogue once you enter a certain area or do a certain thing when hanging out with someone which triggers dialogue

example:

```picking flowers ("that's nice who are you picking those for"),

entering the gun store ("are u crazy!?"),

stealing a car ("atleast the police are horrible and won't do anything"),```


new hangout system maybe,
```the more time you spend hanging out 
with them, you get "friend" points which
adds more dialogue and could also 
potentially commit crimes with you 
depending on the points & the character```


more ways to get money,
```i feel like getting money is too hard 
in this game and the best way is by 
picking flowers or getting lucky with the 
bandit robbing thing
could potentially rob the secretary in the 
mayor's house aswell
robbing banks
more money made when robbing cashiers, depending on the place (gun place 2-3K)
(pizza place 150-300)
(gas station 100-150)
(clothes store 300-450)```

more buildings & an expanded map
```definitely add banks & atms, with general security there```

waypoints
```makes it so that you can place a marker 
somewhere and it will tell you how close 
you are to there (like in 3008)```

losing money when killed (like 5%)
```may be controversial
can store money in atms```

edits:

job experience
```lose job experience if you kill 
somebody on the job,
gain +1 job experience everytime you level up```

health bars
```shows health bars above npcs```

damage levels
```everytime you kill someone you get 
damage experience and when you level up 
your guns do more damage (hard to level up 
though)```

better AI when hanging out
```i notice they take lots of long routes 
instead of short routes, they definitely 
need more routes to go across,
they usually get stuck in places where you can sit down (like the pizza place)```

tools
```more tools to make things run quicker, like harvesting crops/berries```

items
```more items that can make you temporarily run faster, have more health temporarily```

adrenaline function
```you get adrenaline from murdering 
bandits or any significant figure (like 
cashier), not any normal npc
you can also get it by robbing somebody
this makes you run faster, take less 
damage, takes up more energy & thirst
the adrenaline bar goes up to 100%, a 
robbery adds 30%, killing 1 
bandit/significant figure gives 20%
new item called "adrenaline shots"```

punching mechanic
```pretty self explanatory, punching does little damage,
new item called "brass knuckles", doubles punching damage by 2x```

job application system & reputation system
```
__JOB APPLICATION__
the job application system tells you if you have enough job experience for the job, and if you have enough reputation to go through

__REPUTATION__
you gain reputation by working in the hospital, (or serving people in other places, gives less reputation though), you can also gain it by murdering bandits
you lose reputation by murdering innocent people, or killing government secretary```
