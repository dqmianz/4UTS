__dialogue once you enter a certain area or do a certain thing when hanging out with someone which triggers dialogue__

example:

```picking flowers ("that's nice who are you picking those for"),

entering the gun store ("are u crazy!?"),

stealing a car ("atleast the police are horrible and won't do anything"),```


__new hangout system__
```the more time you spend hanging out 
with them, you get "friend" points which
adds more dialogue and could also 
potentially commit crimes with you 
depending on the points & the character```


__more ways to get money__
```i feel like getting money is too hard 
in this game and the best way is by 
picking flowers or getting lucky with the 
bandit robbing thing
could potentially rob the secretary in the 
mayor's house aswell
robbing banks
more money made when robbing cashiers, depending on the place (gun place 2-3K)
(pizza place 150-300)
(gas station 100-150)
(clothes store 300-450)```

__more buildings & an expanded map__
```definitely add banks & atms, with general security there```

__waypoints__
```makes it so that you can place a marker 
somewhere and it will tell you how close 
you are to there (like in 3008)```

__losing money when killed (like 5%)__
```may be controversial
can store money in atms```

edits:

__job experience__
```lose job experience if you kill 
somebody on the job,
gain +1 job experience everytime you level up```

__health bars__
```shows health bars above npcs```

__damage levels__
```everytime you kill someone you get 
damage experience and when you level up 
your guns do more damage (hard to level up 
though)```

__better AI when hanging out__
```i notice they take lots of long routes 
instead of short routes, they definitely 
need more routes to go across,
they usually get stuck in places where you can sit down (like the pizza place)```

__tools__
```more tools to make things run quicker, like harvesting crops/berries```

__items__
```more items that can make you temporarily run faster, have more health temporarily```

__adrenaline function__
```you get adrenaline from murdering 
bandits or any significant figure (like 
cashier), not any normal npc
you can also get it by robbing somebody
this makes you run faster, take less 
damage, takes up more energy & thirst
the adrenaline bar goes up to 100%, a 
robbery adds 30%, killing 1 
bandit/significant figure gives 20%
new item called "adrenaline shots"```

__punching mechanic__
```pretty self explanatory, punching does little damage,
new item called "brass knuckles", doubles punching damage by 2x```

__job application system & reputation system__
```
__JOB APPLICATION__
the job application system tells you if 
you have enough job experience for the 
job, and if you have enough reputation to 
go through

__REPUTATION__
you gain reputation by working in the 
hospital, (or serving people in other 
places, gives less reputation though), you 
can also gain it by murdering bandits
you lose reputation by murdering innocent people, or killing government secretary```

__favourite foods depending on the character__
```for example, ari says her favourite food
is flesh so she gets 20% more bonus from 
eating that (like 20%+ on the energy&food) 
(should be able to obtain flesh when 
killing somebody)```

__SUSPICION BAR__
```when an employee/significant figure or
bandit sees you with a gun, depending on
what it is, their suspicion bar will raise
up slowly or quickly, depending on the 
intensity
of the weapon. if their suspicion bar is full
they will begin to fire at you. a way to 
decrease
the suspicion bar is just to simply move out of
sight```

__LUCK POTIONS__
```luck potions increase the chances of you
getting rares or anything above rare,
2x luck cost: 40
4x luck cost : 160
8x luck cost : 560
16x luck cost : 1200```
